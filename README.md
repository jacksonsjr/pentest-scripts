## Informational

I made these scripts for my needs and tried to understand a little bit of how some bug hunters work and put some of those steps in a logical order for me. </br>\
Until I consider this work finished, I'll continue to study and saw how some people work and put it in features within recon.sh script. :D</br>

### System Requirements

Recommended to run on vps with 1VCPU and 2GB ram.

**Why I need run get-tools.sh with root ou sudo?**

'Cos you need to keep your system updated and install some packages from your distribution repository to prepare your environment to run the recon.sh.

### get-tools.sh

This script detect some systems like Arch Linux, Ubuntu and Kali.</br>
The ideia of this script is prepare your new ***VPS or VM*** with some tools to use on reconnaissance and attack phase.</br>
I also put some wordlists and tools used during reconnaissance phase.</br>

**Profiles**:
 - **recon**: tries to ensure the installation of the necessary binaries for recon.sh, if you notice the only binary checks have been focused on what recon.sh needs;
 - **attack**: get some tools to help on attack step
 - **all**: will install all tools from recon and attack profile  

How get-tools.sh work?

`# ./get-tools.sh -u your_user -p profile` </br>
**or** </br>
`$ sudo -H ./get-tools.sh -u your_user -p profile`</br>

After execution you will have the follow directories structure on user home:

~/pentest </br>
  ├── exploits </br>
  ├── local\_recon </br>
  ├── pentest-scripts </br>
  ├── tools </br>
  └── wordlists </br>

### recon.sh

#### About

recon.sh is a script written in Bash, it is intended to automate some tedious tasks of reconnaissance and information gathering.</br>
This tool allows you to gather some information that should help you identify what to do next and where to look.</br>

For now recon.sh use amass, Sublist3r, certspotter, crt.sh, dnssearch, gobuster, dirsearch, wayback, aquatone.</br>
In the future I pretend to use subfinder, massdns, dnsrecon and others tools to get more subdomains and others information.

#### How recon.sh works?

Default reconnaissance:

`./recon.sh -d domain.com`

Reconnaissance with excluded domains:

`./recon.sh -d domain.com -e excluded.domain.com,other.domain.com`

Reconnaissance informing a new DNS resolver, by default use 8.8.8.8:

`./recon.sh -d domain.com -r 1.1.1.1`

Reconnaissance with brute force using Sublist3r:

`./recon.sh -d domain.com -b yes`

**Attention:** If -b option is omitted, the Sublist3r will execute without brute force.

Reconnaissance with brute force using gobuster and dnssearch:

`./recon.sh -d domain.com -s /path/to/wordlist1,/path/to/wordlist2`

Reconnaissance with directories and files brute force with gobuster and dirsearch:

`./recon.sh -d domain.com -w /path/to/wordlist1,/path/to/wordlist2`

**Attention:** If any word list won't be provided the dicc.txt wordlist from dirsearch will be used by default and just dirsearch will be executed

You can put more than one option, example:

`./recon.sh -d domain.com -b yes -e excluded.domain.com,other.domain.com -s /path/to/wordlist1,/path/to/wordlist2` </br>
**or** </br>
`./recon.sh -d domain.com -w /path/to/wordlist1,/path/to/wordlist2 -b yes` </br>

Use as you need.

#### Main features

- Create a dated folder with recon notes
- Grab subdomains using:
  - Amass, Sublist3r, certspotter and cert.sh
   - Dns bruteforcing using gobuster and dnssearch
- The diff\_domains function to improve the time of execution, get just what change on target infraestructure
- Perform nmap to live hosts
- Probe for live hosts over some ports like 80, 443, 8080, etc
- The web\_data funtion from recon.sh work when you put a list of URLs from file.
  - Perform dirsearch and gobuster for all subdomains 
  - Scrape wayback

## Thanks

[Icaro Torres](https://github.com/icarot) with the ideia to diff files from a day ago to improve the execution time of the script.
